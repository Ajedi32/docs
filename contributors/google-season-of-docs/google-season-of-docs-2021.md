# Google Season of Docs 2021

[![Google Season of Docs 2019](https://github.com/Sing-Li/bbug/raw/master/images/gsodlogo.png)](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/)

[Season of Docs](https://g.co/seasonofdocs) is Google's annual program that fosters collaboration between open source projects and technical writers. 

Season of Docs is a unique program that pairs technical writers with open source mentors to introduce the technical writer to an open source community and provide guidance while the writer works on a real-world open source project. The technical writer ,in turn, provides documentation expertise to the open source organization.

Projects can cover a wide range of fields including Cloud computing, operating systems, graphics, medicine, programming languages, robotics, science, security and many more. Season of Docs is not a recruiting program or an internship but it does provide invaluable experience and looks great on a resume!



## How to apply

Rocket.Chat intends to participate for the 2021 season. See [Google Season of Docs 2021 timeline](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/timeline) for more details.

We are currently developing a [project proposal](google-season-of-docs-2021.md#project-proposal) for this season..

### Project Proposal

## Developer Guides and API Docs Rewrite   \(work in progress - place holder\)

**Mentors:**   @rodrigok,  @ggazzo

**Project description:** 

Working with core developers and the community team at Rocket.Chat this is an opportunity to help other developers get to the code faster, and start working on code and contributing to Rocket.Chat more easily.  
  
Rocket.Chat has different methods and SDKs that can be difficult to navigate for new developers and it can take a lot of time to get them up to a point where they can contribute code.  
  
Documentation is scattered and fragmented and needs bringing together in an easy to read and understand format.  
  
This will include methods for setting up libraries such as the JS SDK, core server code, and mobile application development code   
  
This is an exciting opportunity to work on a cutting edge project with a dynamic group of experienced developers and team members.  
  
Current documentation is under the SDK repository README/Blah

**Related Material**:  JS SDK repository, Mention in BOT's Docs, NPM Package, Documentation 

### Measuring Success

As with many open source projects, Rocket.Chat attracts a large number of young and often inexperienced developers. Rocker.Chat has an enormous and complex code base. New contributors often feel frustrated at being unable to get a test setup running quickly and can lose interest and look for an easier project.

Currently the documentation on getting them started with a development environment is fragmented. Developers need to spend time on basic setup rather than coding, and it is frustrating for new users.

We believe that better written documentation will reduce the time developers need to spend on development setup which can then be spent on actual coding issues.

We believe we will see a decrease in simple support requests, more pull requests and code contributions, leading to higher retention of new developers who want to try developing with Rocket.Chat

## Project Budget Details
